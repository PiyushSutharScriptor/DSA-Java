Heaps are CBT (Complete Binary Tree)

CBT = It is a tree where every parent has atmost 2 childs
      Every level is completely filled accept last level
      Nodes are always added from the left

// Important formulas 1 based index (see tree to understand formulas)
1. Node = i
2. Child(left) = 2*i
3. Child(right) = 2*i+1
4. Parent = i/2
5. Leaf nodes = n/2+1 -> n

// Important formulas 0 based index(see tree to understand formulas)
1. Node = i
2. Child(left) = 2*i+1
3. Child(right) = 2*i+2
4. Parent = (i-1)/2
5. Leaf nodes = n/2-1 -> n

Note : i are the indexes of array



//Insert steps : 
1. Add the element in array (last)
2. Compare it with its parents element
3. Swap if the element>Parent (Keep on doing until idx>1)

//Delete steps(roott) : 
1. Assign arr[size] to arr[1] (root is assigned by last element)
2. Decrease the size (size--)
3. Compare it with its Left and Right child 
4. keep on swapping (largest and idx) until the next child exists
