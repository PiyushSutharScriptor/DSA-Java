Key words : 

Directed Graph 
Undirected Graph

Directed cyclic graph 
Undirected cyclic graph

Path = contains nodes and all are reachable 

Undirected Graph : 
Degree = the number of edges in and out of a node
Total degree of graph = 2*no.of edges

Directed Graph : 
Indegree = no. of edges coming towards node
Outdegree = no. of edges leaving from node

Weighted Graph : 
Values associated for the edges.
if there is no weight for edges then default unit weight is taken.
