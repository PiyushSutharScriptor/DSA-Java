Binary tree : 
    parent node
    child node
    root node
    leaf node
    ancestors nodes

Subtree and going deep Subtree

types of trees : 
    1. Full binary tree : 0 or 2 child
    2. Complete binary tree : all the level should be fulled except last level && leaf node must start child from left 
    3. Perfect binary tree : all the leaf nodes are at same level 
    4. Balanced binary tree : the height of the tree is at max log(n)
    5. Degenerated binary tree : in one direction skewed direction

Dfs : 
    Types : 
    InOrder traversal - left->root->right
    PreOrder traversal - root->left->right
    PostOrder traversal - left->right->root

Bfs : traversal in each level completely (Level order traversal)
